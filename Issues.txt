to figure out which python version is compatible with the matlab version 

the run "conda install python = [X.X]" in the anaconda prompt

5) when running biofeedback_pipeline.ipynb, function height is not defined for input argument of type double in generate_feature_tables.m

change height(data) in generate_feature_tables.m to size(data, 1)

6) If path to DOE experiment training data csv files, c3d files, or ground truth torque STO files is incorrect in the notebook, change the path
